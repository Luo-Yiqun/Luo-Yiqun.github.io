On May 12, 2024, an [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-023-01737-4) from Cambridge University was published in Nature Material.
"**Monopoles had been predicted theoretically, but this is the first time we’ve actually seen a two-dimensional monopole in a naturally occurring magnet**," said co-author Professor Paolo Radaelli, from the University of Oxford, written on the Cambridge news website.
The work invokes hot discussion widely.
If you know the basics of electromagnetism, you must know there are no magnetic monopoles.
So the question remains: Is the work reliable?
Or how do we understand the work?
The short answer is the definitions of magnetic monopoles vary.

For more details, welcome to check my notes on this paper: [English version](/files/Monopole_English.pdf) or [中文版](/files/Monopole_Chinese.pdf).
I am not an expert in magnetism.
I am a PhD in physics, so I am welcome to talk if there is anything wrong.
