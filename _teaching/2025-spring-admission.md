I honorably served as a member in the *admission committee* for the Department of Physics at Carnegie Mellon University for Fall 2025 Ph.D. applicants.

I reviewed Ph.D. applications, evaluated candidates' potential to succeed in a Ph.D. program, and provided recommendations to the admissions committee.
I also participated in candidate discussions and contributed to the final decision-making process as well.

This experience was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of the application process of the Department of Physics, including but not limited to the reliability of the recommendation letters, the importance of the academic and research experiences, other factors not included in the application materials, and the recommendation process.
