I honorably served as a teaching assistant for the course *Physics I for Engineering Students: Electricity and Magnetism* in the spring of 2024.
This course is designed for second-year undergraduate students in the colledge of engineering.


I held regular recitations, communicated with students about challenging materials in office hours, and graded assignments and exams.

I learned a lot from the TA team and through talking with students.
